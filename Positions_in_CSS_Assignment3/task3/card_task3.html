            <h3>The Earth!!!</h3>
            <p>
                The natural world is an incredible wonder that inspires us all. 
                It underpins our economy, our society, indeed our very existence. 
                Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with. 
                We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our health, happiness and prosperity. 

                These natural assets are often called the world's 'natural capital'. 
                These benefits are also hugely important to the economy from farming and forestry to leisure and tourism. 
                If you add them all up, the total value of these benefits is phenomenal-at least US$125 trillion every year.
                
                Because nature is free, we often take it for granted and overexploit it. 
                We clear forests, overfish oceans, pollute rivers and build over wetlands without taking account of the impact this will have. 
                By not taking into account the benefits we get from nature, we create huge social and economic costs for ourselves.
